* Take a tour around the code - don't miss `ApiTests`
* Fix the `should_return_all_employees` test
* Take a look at `BenefitService`.
  * Implement `CreateBenefit` method (you're free to change the declaration of that method as it is not used anywhere)
  * Look at the `AddBenefitForEmployee` method. Choose and write tests on the appropriate layers. Don't fear to refactor if needed
* Take a look into the `EmployeeService`, the `GetTotalEmployeeCompensation`.
  * Write an acceptance test
  * Implement the method
* Take a look at the `ApiTests` again. Can those tests be improved after introducing previous changes?
